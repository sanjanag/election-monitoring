"JohnDramaniMahama AND THE NDCâ€™S UNACCEPTABLE SYSTEMATIC RIGGING OF ELECTION 2012
 
The NPP has credible evidence, which undermines the integrity of the electoral process and the results officially released to date in respect of the 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections.  

It is obvious from the preponderance of evidence available to us that at all material times the ruling National Democratic Congress led by President JohnDramaniMahama conspired with certain EC staff in constituencies across the country to falsify the election results and thereby abuse the mandate of the people of Ghana. This situation, if allowed to go unchallenged, would seriously damage the essence of the electoral process and largely democracy in Ghana.

Substantial discrepancies have been discovered from results from collation centres when compared with the official tally figures from the EC. Considering the closeness of the polls this error is very significant and goes to the heart of the credibility of the results. Indeed, we have enough concrete evidence to show that the 2012 presidential election was won by our candidate, NanaAkufo-Addo.

It was this planned, systematic stealing of votes at the collation level that was, thankfully, discovered in time at the Dome Kwabenya constituency, where a substantial amount of 15,000 votes was illegally added to the total vote cast in favour of JohnDramaniMahama of the NDC. Also, in Savelugu constituency, JohnDramaniMahama of the NDC received 21,165 votes according to the EC at the collation centre. However in actual fact, 31,165 votes have been falsely declared for him. Like in all the other instances revealing this pattern of fraud, we have the blue sheets to support this blatant act of rape of the democratic mandate of the people of Ghana. The stealing of votes cast in favour of NanaAkufo-Addo is rife with fraudulent irregularities as reflected in results from Yendi constituency where more than ten thousand votes in that instance have been erased.

Unfortunately, the discovery of some of these criminal acts is done only after the collated results are declared at the constituency. We have noticed a pattern of fraud, where substantial numbers of votes are either added to the NDC candidate or subtracted from the NPP presidential candidate. 

What is especially troubling is that the media have been announcing figures from the constituency collation centres that have obviously been tampered with when compared with figures from the tallying sheets (â€˜blue sheetsâ€™) and this is giving a highly misleading picture to the people of Ghana.  For example, Peace FM and Joy FM have both announced 10,000 more votes for JohnDramaniMahama, the NDC Presidential Candidate, than what was declared for him at the Ledzokuku collation centre, giving him 63,210 (60.53%), instead of 53,210. 

This systematic manipulation of the figures across the country casts serious doubt on the credibility of the results. The manipulation has taken place mainly on the collation sheets. We see the tally figures on the â€˜blue sheetsâ€™ in many constituencies do not match the figures on the collation sheet. 

We demand that the EC conducts an audit of the collated figures as well as the counts from the biometric verification machines before the electoral results are finally released. The biometric machines that were reported to be faulty on the first day of voting in the North, miraculously worked perfectly well the next day without them being replaced or repaired.  
 
The No Verification, No Vote, rule was also blatantly defied in several places, especially in the Upper West, Upper East and Volta Regions. In Bawku Central, Nadowli, and Salaga South, for example, high voter turnouts were registered in areas where voting occurred without the use of the verification machine. In North Tongu, for example where there was no verification, the effect of non-verification obvious. JohnDramaniMahama supposedly got 34,162 in North Tongu without verification. This happened with the direct collusion of polling station officers and upwards, after the President personally called for a violation of this rule.

The size of this manipulation has influenced the final outcome. Also consistent with this systematic manipulation is the fact that the total votes cast at the presidential level are far higher than the votes cast for parliamentary candidates and most of the time we have seen this happening, are the very places where we see the collation figures manipulated.

We call upon our party members and the general public to ignore the tainted provisional results announced through the mass media. Indeed, already the election has been called for the NDC candidate by one major media house, Multi Media.  But, there again discrepancies have been detected. For example, for Berekum West, Joy FM gave the NDC presidential candidate 7,750 and the NPP presidential candidate, 10,189. But, the ECâ€™s own results on its website, state 9,091 for the NDC and 6,236 for the NPP. Also in Akwatia, Joy gives the NDC candidate 19,118 and the NPP candidate 20,678. The EC, on the other hand, gives the NDC candidate 18,963 and the NPP candidate 20,506 votes. So, we call on the people of Ghana to remain calm and wait for a proper audit of the results before declaration.

The connivance of EC staff in this electoral fraud is most worrying. For example, in the Yapei/Kusawgu constituency, the presiding officer at the Kakalito polling station recorded zero (0) for our presidential candidate. However upon a recount of the ballots, our candidate got forty-nine (49) votes. 
 
Our Presidential Candidate, NanaAkufo-Addo earlier on raised these serious concerns about the reliability of the election results with the ECOWAS observer mission headed by Gen Obasanjo when they paid a visit to him this morning. 

We respectfully demand the EC not to release any official result until these extremely serious concerns are investigated thoroughly and its findings pronounced.  We also call for an immediate meeting with Chairman of the Electoral Commission. These results cannot be forced down on the people of Ghana as same will be subversive of their constitutional right to determine who leads them.",Nana Akufo Addo Facebook,12/9/2012 15:35,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,,,,,,,

"Why the Best Candidate Did Not Win - By Kofi Thompson, an independent blogger:

When a friend in the U.S.A. asked me who I thought would win the presidential election in Ghana, for an answer, I told him who I knew would definitely not win that election - by recounting to him what a brilliant young female student told me, when I asked a group of university students the same question.

In the view of that brilliant female student, nothing would change in Ghana, regardless of which candidate of the two major political parties that have governed the nation since the 1992 constitution was promulgated - the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party - won the presidential election, because both simply lacked the political will to fight high-level corruption: which she regarded as the biggest nation-building challenge facing Ghana.

The tragedy for Ghana, she said, was that the person who had shown, by deed, not words - by making public the results of the medical examination he underwent to show he was medically fit for the ardours task of leading Ghana; releasing his filed tax returns and declaring his assets openly to the media; as well as showing the amount spent on campaigning by the party he founded, and the sources of its funding to show he was transparent about financial matters he was associated with - would not win the presidential election.

She ended by saying she was certain that Ghana (a nation full of ""My-party-my-tribe-right-or-wrong"" myrmidon-types) would miss the opportunity to elect the candidate who had shown the discerning that he was the most suitable politician to lead the Ghana of today, for a number of reasons - all of them negative.

To begin with, it was her opinion that Dr. Paa Kwesi Nduom of the Progressive Peoples Party would not win the presidential election, because: ""Behind the facade of modernity, in terms of the psychology of a majority of the populace, in a sense, Ghana is a nation in which superstition is rife and deeply woven into the fabric of society. That is one of the reasons why the political party most favoured by sundry crooks-in-dog-collars - who speak in 'tongues' and exert a malevolent influence over the minds of the millions who flock to their churches regularly to seek 'prophetic anointing' and 'protection from spiritual enemies' - can garner a substantial number of votes in elections. And, lastly, tribal bigotry is written into the DNA of some of the most prominent and influential of today's descendants of the pre-colonial traditional ruling elites - who, even though it is a democracy, still seek to dominate the Republic of Ghana through the back-door by proxy - and those ordinary Ghana who hold fealty to them, often demonstrate their allegiance by voting for the political parties such tribal-supremacist traditionalists support."" And well said, say I.

How insightful that young Ghanaian was. Alas, indeed as it turned out, most voters did not vote for the candidate who by voluntarily undergoing a medical examination and making public the results, as well as releasing his filed tax returns from the 1980's to date; and publicly declaring his assets to the media, and topped all that by revealing the total amount spent by the party he founded and the sources of its funding, showed Ghana (including a doubting-Thomas like me who has often criticised him in the past for attempting a reverse-takeover of the party founded by the great Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the Convention Peoples Party - and advised he leave Nkrumah's party to set up one of his own, in which he could call the shots), that in good governance terms, he was the best amongst this year's crop of presidential candidates - and could offer the kind of sorely-needed world-class leadership (underpinned by an ethical ethos), which the people of Ghana and their peaceful and democratic nation require to prosper.

Sadly, dear reader, as it turns out that young female university student was right in asserting that the candidate who proved he was best suited to lead Ghana, would not win the presidential election - and that Mother Ghana will be the worst for it. Pity.

CODEO Preliminary Statement on Ghana's Presidential and General  Elections #ghanaelections #ghanadecides http://t.co/oyvaybUQ,Twitter,12/9/2012 15:39,IDEGGhana,,,,,,,
"JohnDramaniMahama AND THE NDCâ€™S UNACCEPTABLE SYSTEMATIC RIGGING OF ELECTION 2012
 
The NPP has credible evidence, which undermines the integrity of the electoral process and the results officially released to date in respect of the 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections.  

It is obvious from the preponderance of evidence available to us that at all material times the ruling National Democratic Congress led by President JohnDramaniMahama conspired with certain EC staff in constituencies across the country to falsify the election results and thereby abuse the mandate of the people of Ghana. This situation, if allowed to go unchallenged, would seriously damage the essence of the electoral process and largely democracy in Ghana.

Substantial discrepancies have been discovered from results from collation centres when compared with the official tally figures from the EC. Considering the closeness of the polls this error is very significant and goes to the heart of the credibility of the results. Indeed, we have enough concrete evidence to show that the 2012 presidential election was won by our candidate, NanaAkufo-Addo.

It was this planned, systematic stealing of votes at the collation level that was, thankfully, discovered in time at the Dome Kwabenya constituency, where a substantial amount of 15,000 votes was illegally added to the total vote cast in favour of JohnDramaniMahama of the NDC. Also, in Savelugu constituency, JohnDramaniMahama of the NDC received 21,165 votes according to the EC at the collation centre. However in actual fact, 31,165 votes have been falsely declared for him. Like in all the other instances revealing this pattern of fraud, we have the blue sheets to support this blatant act of rape of the democratic mandate of the people of Ghana. The stealing of votes cast in favour of NanaAkufo-Addo is rife with fraudulent irregularities as reflected in results from Yendi constituency where more than ten thousand votes in that instance have been erased.

Unfortunately, the discovery of some of these criminal acts is done only after the collated results are declared at the constituency. We have noticed a pattern of fraud, where substantial numbers of votes are either added to the NDC candidate or subtracted from the NPP presidential candidate. 

What is especially troubling is that the media have been announcing figures from the constituency collation centres that have obviously been tampered with when compared with figures from the tallying sheets (â€˜blue sheetsâ€™) and this is giving a highly misleading picture to the people of Ghana.  For example, Peace FM and Joy FM have both announced 10,000 more votes for JohnDramaniMahama, the NDC Presidential Candidate, than what was declared for him at the Ledzokuku collation centre, giving him 63,210 (60.53%), instead of 53,210. 

This systematic manipulation of the figures across the country casts serious doubt on the credibility of the results. The manipulation has taken place mainly on the collation sheets. We see the tally figures on the â€˜blue sheetsâ€™ in many constituencies do not match the figures on the collation sheet. 

We demand that the EC conducts an audit of the collated figures as well as the counts from the biometric verification machines before the electoral results are finally released. The biometric machines that were reported to be faulty on the first day of voting in the North, miraculously worked perfectly well the next day without them being replaced or repaired.  
 
The No Verification, No Vote, rule was also blatantly defied in several places, especially in the Upper West, Upper East and Volta Regions. In Bawku Central, Nadowli, and Salaga South, for example, high voter turnouts were registered in areas where voting occurred without the use of the verification machine. In North Tongu, for example where there was no verification, the effect of non-verification obvious. JohnDramaniMahama supposedly got 34,162 in North Tongu without verification. This happened with the direct collusion of polling station officers and upwards, after the President personally called for a violation of this rule.

The size of this manipulation has influenced the final outcome. Also consistent with this systematic manipulation is the fact that the total votes cast at the presidential level are far higher than the votes cast for parliamentary candidates and most of the time we have seen this happening, are the very places where we see the collation figures manipulated.

We call upon our party members and the general public to ignore the tainted provisional results announced through the mass media. Indeed, already the election has been called for the NDC candidate by one major media house, Multi Media.  But, there again discrepancies have been detected. For example, for Berekum West, Joy FM gave the NDC presidential candidate 7,750 and the NPP presidential candidate, 10,189. But, the ECâ€™s own results on its website, state 9,091 for the NDC and 6,236 for the NPP. Also in Akwatia, Joy gives the NDC candidate 19,118 and the NPP candidate 20,678. The EC, on the other hand, gives the NDC candidate 18,963 and the NPP candidate 20,506 votes. So, we call on the people of Ghana to remain calm and wait for a proper audit of the results before declaration.

The connivance of EC staff in this electoral fraud is most worrying. For example, in the Yapei/Kusawgu constituency, the presiding officer at the Kakalito polling station recorded zero (0) for our presidential candidate. However upon a recount of the ballots, our candidate got forty-nine (49) votes. 
 
Our Presidential Candidate, NanaAkufo-Addo earlier on raised these serious concerns about the reliability of the election results with the ECOWAS observer mission headed by Gen Obasanjo when they paid a visit to him this morning. 

We respectfully demand the EC not to release any official result until these extremely serious concerns are investigated thoroughly and its findings pronounced.  We also call for an immediate meeting with Chairman of the Electoral Commission. These results cannot be forced down on the people of Ghana as same will be subversive of their constitutional right to determine who leads them.",Nana Akufo Addo Facebook,12/9/2012 15:35,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,,,,,,,

"Why the Best Candidate Did Not Win - By Kofi Thompson, an independent blogger:

When a friend in the U.S.A. asked me who I thought would win the presidential election in Ghana, for an answer, I told him who I knew would definitely not win that election - by recounting to him what a brilliant young female student told me, when I asked a group of university students the same question.

In the view of that brilliant female student, nothing would change in Ghana, regardless of which candidate of the two major political parties that have governed the nation since the 1992 constitution was promulgated - the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party - won the presidential election, because both simply lacked the political will to fight high-level corruption: which she regarded as the biggest nation-building challenge facing Ghana.

The tragedy for Ghana, she said, was that the person who had shown, by deed, not words - by making public the results of the medical examination he underwent to show he was medically fit for the ardours task of leading Ghana; releasing his filed tax returns and declaring his assets openly to the media; as well as showing the amount spent on campaigning by the party he founded, and the sources of its funding to show he was transparent about financial matters he was associated with - would not win the presidential election.

She ended by saying she was certain that Ghana (a nation full of ""My-party-my-tribe-right-or-wrong"" myrmidon-types) would miss the opportunity to elect the candidate who had shown the discerning that he was the most suitable politician to lead the Ghana of today, for a number of reasons - all of them negative.

To begin with, it was her opinion that Dr. Paa Kwesi Nduom of the Progressive Peoples Party would not win the presidential election, because: ""Behind the facade of modernity, in terms of the psychology of a majority of the populace, in a sense, Ghana is a nation in which superstition is rife and deeply woven into the fabric of society. That is one of the reasons why the political party most favoured by sundry crooks-in-dog-collars - who speak in 'tongues' and exert a malevolent influence over the minds of the millions who flock to their churches regularly to seek 'prophetic anointing' and 'protection from spiritual enemies' - can garner a substantial number of votes in elections. And, lastly, tribal bigotry is written into the DNA of some of the most prominent and influential of today's descendants of the pre-colonial traditional ruling elites - who, even though it is a democracy, still seek to dominate the Republic of Ghana through the back-door by proxy - and those ordinary Ghana who hold fealty to them, often demonstrate their allegiance by voting for the political parties such tribal-supremacist traditionalists support."" And well said, say I.

How insightful that young Ghanaian was. Alas, indeed as it turned out, most voters did not vote for the candidate who by voluntarily undergoing a medical examination and making public the results, as well as releasing his filed tax returns from the 1980's to date; and publicly declaring his assets to the media, and topped all that by revealing the total amount spent by the party he founded and the sources of its funding, showed Ghana (including a doubting-Thomas like me who has often criticised him in the past for attempting a reverse-takeover of the party founded by the great Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the Convention Peoples Party - and advised he leave Nkrumah's party to set up one of his own, in which he could call the shots), that in good governance terms, he was the best amongst this year's crop of presidential candidates - and could offer the kind of sorely-needed world-class leadership (underpinned by an ethical ethos), which the people of Ghana and their peaceful and democratic nation require to prosper.

Sadly, dear reader, as it turns out that young female university student was right in asserting that the candidate who proved he was best suited to lead Ghana, would not win the presidential election - and that Mother Ghana will be the worst for it. Pity.

Breaking News! Voting tomorrow..in areas where the biometric verification machine did not work...,Twitter,12/7/2012 18:21,MrHaglah,,,,,,,
"EC AND ECG, FACILITATE THE VOTE; NPP DEMANDS

The New Patriotic Party (NPP) has observed that for an election which started seven hours late in some polling stations, the EC has a duty to ensure that all qualified voters willing and able to vote are facilitated to cast their votes. 

With polling slated to close at 5pm, hundreds of thousands of Ghana remain stranded in long queues all over the country. The NPP demands that these patriotic Ghana are enabled to vote as per the EC instruction that once a person is in a queue at 5pm, that person must be allowed to vote. 

The NPP is even more worried that in many places all over the ocuntry, the Verification Machines have broken down. Voters are waiting without any information or technical attention. We demand that the EC put all the technical capacity and spare Verification Machines at its command into the field to ensure that the election ends well. 

This election is based on only one standard. NO VERIFICATION NO VOTE. No party will accept manual verification after the fact in the field and where results are purportedly reported without verification, such results should be rejected outright. Hence it is a legitimate and necessary demand that EC deliver verification machines that function if the election is to be deemed up to the ECâ€™s own standard. . 

Late voting and counting makes electrical energy essential. VRA, GRIDCo and ECG promised the entire country power but large pockets of the country remain in the dark. Moreover, we do not have any guarantees that the lights will stay on for the counting phase of the election. 

It is vital that there is electricity because the understanding is that three thousand vigilantes have been mobilised to disrupt the process in the dark. 

ALSO, SOME ELECTORAL OFFICERS ARE THREATENING to take boxes away to count elsewhere. Please, all counting and declaration is done at the polling station in the full glare of the public. All polling station agents should not allow or accept the transportation of ballot boxes anywhere by anybody until after counting and signature of the relevant documentation. 

The EC must warn its officers not to count the uncompleted ballot where people are still in the queue waiting for a verification machine.

The NPP believes the election is capable of passing of fairly and freely if the EC and the ECG live up to their responsibilities to Ghana.

"ADJOURNMENT OF POLL AT POLLING STATIONS WHERE BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION OF VOTERS COULD NOT BE   COMPLETED.

The Electoral Commission directs as follows;

(1) At polling stations where the biometric verification of voters could not be completed  and as a result  some voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,

(2) Where election materials arrived very late that all the voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,
polling should continue tomorrow, Saturday 8th December, 2012 to give the opportunity to the affected persons to vote.

Where the poll is adjourned to a new date shall be taken from 7:00am to 5:00pm.
Presiding Officers should arrange with the police for the safe custody of all ballot boxes and election materials.

"NPP CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR RESPECT OF THE LAW

The Chairman of the New Patriotic Party, Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, has asked Ghana and all institutions involved in the conduct of the 2012 elections as well as the political parties to respect the electoral laws governing this election.

The NPP sympathises with Ghana who have been on their feet, in some instances, for over 11 hours and yet have been disappointed because they could not vote.

The NPP understands that the EC is preparing to continue the process tomorrow and that areas where voting was stopped due to a lack of functional verification machines will vote tomorrow. In such areas, the process, according to the law must be:

1.      COUNT the votes already deposited in the ballot box by biometrically verified voters
2.      RECORD the votes counted
3.      SEAL the ballot box (done by representatives of all parties)

The remaining votes unable to be cast because of verification machine issues will be cast beginning on Saturday morning.  Note that this process of COUNT, RECORD, SEAL only applies to polling stations in which machines failed to function.  In polling places with functioning machines, voting must continue on Friday until all voters who had queued before 5:00 pm have cast their votes.

We further call upon all members of the security services to discharge their duties with integrity, in order to preserve a legal and legitimate election according to the COUNT, RECORD, SEAL process.  If the COUNT, RECORD, SEAL process is not followed, we may seek to annul the results of the votes already cast, and to hold fresh elections.

It is a proud tradition that in every successive Ghanaian election, we strengthen the electoral system and therefore we believe Ghana will bear the inconvenience of continuing to vote tomorrow, rather than open this election to manipulation and in the process destroy the legitimacy we seek as a society.

Ghana is at an important crossroads. NPP urges Ghana to support the EC to deliver a clean, free, fair and legitimate election.

"Statement of the EC on the voting situation at some polling centres:

ADJOURNMENT OF POLL AT POLLING STATIONS WHERE BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION OF VOTERS COULD NOT BE COMPLETED.

The Electoral Commission directs as follows;

(1) At polling stations where the biometric verification of voters could not be completed and as a result some voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,

(2) Where election materials arrived very late that all the voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,polling should continue tomorrow, Saturday 8th December, 2012 to give the opportunity to the affected persons to vote.

Presiding Officers should arrange with the police for the safe custody of all ballot boxes and election materials.

"NPP REMINDS NDC: SATURDAYâ€™S VOTING TAKES PLACE IN ONLY 1% OF TOTAL NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS

Boakye Agyarko, the Campaign Manager of NanaAkufo-Addo's campaign for President, today predicted with confidence a solid first round victory for the NPP presidential candidate.  

With only a fraction of votes in less than one percent of polling stations yet to be cast, due to faulty biometric verification machines on December 7, the President of the Republic and the ruling National Democratic Congress are clutching at straws and creating the impression as if the remaining votes, when cast, can overturn the obvious defeat that the ruling party has suffered in this election. 

Mr. Boakye Agyarko said the NDC should not use the problem which affected a relatively tiny number of polling centres as an excuse for their bad showing in Fridayâ€™s presidential and parliamentary polls. For example, voting will take place Saturday in 73 polling stations in Greater Accra, 25 in the Central Region and only 2 in the Volta Region. 

â€œThis cannot be said to amount to a disaster, especially, when there is an opportunity to redress this matter today,â€ he said.

â€œWe are happy that the EC, in accordance with the law, will allow voters who missed out Friday, as a result of faulty equipment, to exercise their franchise today, Saturday, December 8. We are, therefore, calling on all our supporters to come out once again in their numbers and vote.â€

But, the NPP Campaign Manager could not hide his partyâ€™s disappointment with attempts by the NDC to discredit the elections. â€œWe do not think it is proper for the NDC to seek to use this relatively marginal percentage of total votes left to be cast to say that the 2012 general elections have been marred, as the NDC has sought to do,â€ he said.   
 
The President, on Friday, called for people to be allowed to vote without biometric verification, contrary to the law. This has been condemned by the NPP as â€œirresponsible and unnecessary.â€  

Mr Boakye Agyarko has urged the President and NDC Presidential Candidate, JohnDramaniMahama, to stop making unlawful pronouncements on the electoral process and display good sportsmanship in allowing the rest of the voters, who were unable to cast their votes on December 7 to proceed on Saturday to exercise their franchise, in a transparent and lawful manner, according to the biometric process. 

The NPP Campaign Manager has described the call by the President of the Republic, Friday, that voters must proceed to vote without subjecting their identity to biometric verification, as ""dangerous and irresponsible,"" adding, ""it is the last shrill of a government which knows it has lost but is desperately seeking for any illegitimate opening to overturn the people's mandate."" 

""We are calling on the EC to stick strictly to the law, which gives voters in all polling stations where voting was suspended yesterday an opportunity to cast their ballots today, using biometric verification so that a legitimate and clear victory for NanaAkufo-Addo can be declared as quickly as possible once all votes are cast, and a transition process from Mr JohnDramaniMahama's caretaker Presidency can begin.""

""Based on all the data being received, NanaAkufo-Addo is on course to win a 1st round victory with an incontestable margin.  NPP parliamentary candidates are winning seats that we had never won before. This, which is happening across the country, is a clear indication of an NPP victory, which will produce a parliamentary majority, as well, and the general performance of our parliamentary candidate is exceeding expectations.  We have challengers who have upset sitting MPs and Ministers, which shows that NanaAkufo-Addo and the NPP's vision of change and transforming Ghana has resonated with voters and has resulted in a clear victory.""

Agyarko cited high turnout in the Ashanti Region, expected to be over 80% in the NPP stronghold.  He also pointed out higher than usual NPP support in the Northern Region, and anemic NDC turnout in their primary stronghold, the Volta region.

Agyarko thanked voters for their patience and enthusiasm for the free and fair process.  He assured them that no one would be disenfranchised, and reiterated his call to the Electoral Commission and the security services to discharge their duties with excellence so that all voters can express their will on Saturday morning in a credible and legitimate vote.  In closing, he reiterated the NPP's demand that the NDC Presidential Candidate, JohnDramaniMahama, immediately backs down from his effort to stonewall a free, fair, and legitimate vote by attacking the biometric process that assures credibility and integrity of Ghana' votes.",Nana Akufo Addo Facebook,12/8/2012 6:40,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,,,,,,,

".NDC Is Coasting To One Touch Victory

By Margaret Jackson

December 8, 2012

The Joy News, Peace FM, and Adom FM among others did something yesterday that they were very good at: Sending panic waves among the NDC supporters.

What they did was to announce some series of Presidential and Parliamentary results that NanaAkufo-Addo and some NPP parliamentary candidates had won. For well over FOUR hours after the polls closed, they consistently announced results that favoured the NPP leaving some NDC stalwarts crestfallen and in panic mode.

But unbeknown to the teeming NDC supporters and the Ghanaian populace, the results were far from what was being churned out by these radio stations. Clearly, the NDC did far better than what was being portrayed.

The NDCâ€™s own internal exit polls have shown startling results: The NDC IS COASTING TO A ONE TOUCH VICTORY. That is my prediction and itâ€™s not going to be close. The NDC is sure to cause a political tsunami when the final results are announced. I can say with all certainty thatNanaAkufo-Addo will go down real hard.

Therefore, I am urging all NDC supporters to remain calm. God has done it. Those who could not vote in certain areas due to the malfunctioning of voting machines and other hiccups should go and exercise their votes today.

It is looking really good for the NDC. The party has done enough to cage the NPP at where it wants it to be. I can say with all Joy that when the results finally trick in from the EC, the NDC supporters will have something to laugh about.

Indeed the Battle Was The Lordâ€™s and HE HAD DONE IT FOR THE NDC. AMEN!

Boakye Agyarko, NPP Campaign Manager, this afternoon urged all party polling agents in the few places which voted today to check the serial numbers of every ballot paper.  This will ensure the authenticity of the cast ballots that were kept overnight after voting was suspended because of technical issues with biometric verification. The NPP had insisted on the ballots from yesterday to be ""counted, recorded and sealed."" However, this did not happen in most cases. 

According to the NPP Campaign Manager, the party, which has picked up significant seats across the country, including increasing its seats in NDC stronghold, the Northern Region, by at least 3-fold, is steadily on course to win the presidential contest. 

""With NDC fast exhausting its votes in its strongholds and most of the figures from our strongholds yet to be declared, we have every reason to stay confident about our victory. What is left is for our agents to stay vigilant, scrutinise every ballot to secure victory."" 

Boakye Agyarko urged NPP polling agents at the 169 polling stations, where voting took place today, to continue to exercise caution and to remain at the height of vigilance until the last ballot box is sealed and the last vote counted, taking note of the serial numbers on ballot box seals.

""We also demand transparency and impartiality from the Electoral Commission.  Any meeting held by the Electoral Commission must be convened in the presence of all parties, including the NPP.  We cannot be sure of a free, fair, credible and legitimate election if actions are taken that appear to suggest figures are being tampered with. We have been tracking our figures right from the polling station and are very confident of our victory,"" he said.

Boakye Agyarko thanked voters for their patience and enthusiasm for the free and fair process.  He assured them that the NPP would be victorious once all the votes were counted, and that no one would be disenfranchised, reiterating his call to the security services to discharge their duties with excellence so that all voters can express their will today in a credible and legitimate vote.",Nana Akufo Addo Facebook,12/8/2012 15:38,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,,,,,,,
