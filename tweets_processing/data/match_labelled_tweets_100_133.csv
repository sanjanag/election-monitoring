"NPP REMINDS NDC: SATURDAYâ€™S VOTING TAKES PLACE IN ONLY 1% OF TOTAL NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS

Boakye Agyarko, the Campaign Manager of NanaAkufo-Addo's campaign for President, today predicted with confidence a solid first round victory for the NPP presidential candidate.  

With only a fraction of votes in less than one percent of polling stations yet to be cast, due to faulty biometric verification machines on December 7, the President of the Republic and the ruling National Democratic Congress are clutching at straws and creating the impression as if the remaining votes, when cast, can overturn the obvious defeat that the ruling party has suffered in this election. 

Mr. Boakye Agyarko said the NDC should not use the problem which affected a relatively tiny number of polling centres as an excuse for their bad showing in Fridayâ€™s presidential and parliamentary polls. For example, voting will take place Saturday in 73 polling stations in Greater Accra, 25 in the Central Region and only 2 in the Volta Region. 

â€œThis cannot be said to amount to a disaster, especially, when there is an opportunity to redress this matter today,â€ he said.

â€œWe are happy that the EC, in accordance with the law, will allow voters who missed out Friday, as a result of faulty equipment, to exercise their franchise today, Saturday, December 8. We are, therefore, calling on all our supporters to come out once again in their numbers and vote.â€

But, the NPP Campaign Manager could not hide his partyâ€™s disappointment with attempts by the NDC to discredit the elections. â€œWe do not think it is proper for the NDC to seek to use this relatively marginal percentage of total votes left to be cast to say that the 2012 general elections have been marred, as the NDC has sought to do,â€ he said.   
 
The President, on Friday, called for people to be allowed to vote without biometric verification, contrary to the law. This has been condemned by the NPP as â€œirresponsible and unnecessary.â€  

Mr Boakye Agyarko has urged the President and NDC Presidential Candidate, JohnDramaniMahama, to stop making unlawful pronouncements on the electoral process and display good sportsmanship in allowing the rest of the voters, who were unable to cast their votes on December 7 to proceed on Saturday to exercise their franchise, in a transparent and lawful manner, according to the biometric process. 

The NPP Campaign Manager has described the call by the President of the Republic, Friday, that voters must proceed to vote without subjecting their identity to biometric verification, as ""dangerous and irresponsible,"" adding, ""it is the last shrill of a government which knows it has lost but is desperately seeking for any illegitimate opening to overturn the people's mandate."" 

""We are calling on the EC to stick strictly to the law, which gives voters in all polling stations where voting was suspended yesterday an opportunity to cast their ballots today, using biometric verification so that a legitimate and clear victory for NanaAkufo-Addo can be declared as quickly as possible once all votes are cast, and a transition process from Mr JohnDramaniMahama's caretaker Presidency can begin.""

""Based on all the data being received, NanaAkufo-Addo is on course to win a 1st round victory with an incontestable margin.  NPP parliamentary candidates are winning seats that we had never won before. This, which is happening across the country, is a clear indication of an NPP victory, which will produce a parliamentary majority, as well, and the general performance of our parliamentary candidate is exceeding expectations.  We have challengers who have upset sitting MPs and Ministers, which shows that NanaAkufo-Addo and the NPP's vision of change and transforming Ghana has resonated with voters and has resulted in a clear victory.""

Agyarko cited high turnout in the Ashanti Region, expected to be over 80% in the NPP stronghold.  He also pointed out higher than usual NPP support in the Northern Region, and anemic NDC turnout in their primary stronghold, the Volta region.

Agyarko thanked voters for their patience and enthusiasm for the free and fair process.  He assured them that no one would be disenfranchised, and reiterated his call to the Electoral Commission and the security services to discharge their duties with excellence so that all voters can express their will on Saturday morning in a credible and legitimate vote.  In closing, he reiterated the NPP's demand that the NDC Presidential Candidate, JohnDramaniMahama, immediately backs down from his effort to stonewall a free, fair, and legitimate vote by attacking the biometric process that assures credibility and integrity of Ghana' votes.",Nana Akufo Addo Facebook,12/8/2012 6:40,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,,,,,,

".NDC Is Coasting To One Touch Victory

By Margaret Jackson

December 8, 2012

The Joy News, Peace FM, and Adom FM among others did something yesterday that they were very good at: Sending panic waves among the NDC supporters.

What they did was to announce some series of Presidential and Parliamentary results that NanaAkufo-Addo and some NPP parliamentary candidates had won. For well over FOUR hours after the polls closed, they consistently announced results that favoured the NPP leaving some NDC stalwarts crestfallen and in panic mode.

But unbeknown to the teeming NDC supporters and the Ghanaian populace, the results were far from what was being churned out by these radio stations. Clearly, the NDC did far better than what was being portrayed.

The NDCâ€™s own internal exit polls have shown startling results: The NDC IS COASTING TO A ONE TOUCH VICTORY. That is my prediction and itâ€™s not going to be close. The NDC is sure to cause a political tsunami when the final results are announced. I can say with all certainty thatNanaAkufo-Addo will go down real hard.

Therefore, I am urging all NDC supporters to remain calm. God has done it. Those who could not vote in certain areas due to the malfunctioning of voting machines and other hiccups should go and exercise their votes today.

It is looking really good for the NDC. The party has done enough to cage the NPP at where it wants it to be. I can say with all Joy that when the results finally trick in from the EC, the NDC supporters will have something to laugh about.

Indeed the Battle Was The Lordâ€™s and HE HAD DONE IT FOR THE NDC. AMEN!

"NPP CHARGES POLLING AGENTS TO CHECK ALL BALLOT SERIAL NUMBERS TO SECURE VICTORY

Boakye Agyarko, NPP Campaign Manager, this afternoon urged all party polling agents in the few places which voted today to check the serial numbers of every ballot paper.  This will ensure the authenticity of the cast ballots that were kept overnight after voting was suspended because of technical issues with biometric verification. The NPP had insisted on the ballots from yesterday to be ""counted, recorded and sealed."" However, this did not happen in most cases. 

According to the NPP Campaign Manager, the party, which has picked up significant seats across the country, including increasing its seats in NDC stronghold, the Northern Region, by at least 3-fold, is steadily on course to win the presidential contest. 

""With NDC fast exhausting its votes in its strongholds and most of the figures from our strongholds yet to be declared, we have every reason to stay confident about our victory. What is left is for our agents to stay vigilant, scrutinise every ballot to secure victory."" 

Boakye Agyarko urged NPP polling agents at the 169 polling stations, where voting took place today, to continue to exercise caution and to remain at the height of vigilance until the last ballot box is sealed and the last vote counted, taking note of the serial numbers on ballot box seals.

""We also demand transparency and impartiality from the Electoral Commission.  Any meeting held by the Electoral Commission must be convened in the presence of all parties, including the NPP.  We cannot be sure of a free, fair, credible and legitimate election if actions are taken that appear to suggest figures are being tampered with. We have been tracking our figures right from the polling station and are very confident of our victory,"" he said.

Boakye Agyarko thanked voters for their patience and enthusiasm for the free and fair process.  He assured them that the NPP would be victorious once all the votes were counted, and that no one would be disenfranchised, reiterating his call to the security services to discharge their duties with excellence so that all voters can express their will today in a credible and legitimate vote.",Nana Akufo Addo Facebook,12/8/2012 15:38,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,,,,,,
