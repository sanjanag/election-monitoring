"ADJOURNMENT OF POLL AT POLLING STATIONS WHERE BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION OF VOTERS COULD NOT BE   COMPLETED.

The Electoral Commission directs as follows;

(1) At polling stations where the biometric verification of voters could not be completed  and as a result  some voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,

(2) Where election materials arrived very late that all the voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,
polling should continue tomorrow, Saturday 8th December, 2012 to give the opportunity to the affected persons to vote.

Where the poll is adjourned to a new date shall be taken from 7:00am to 5:00pm.
Presiding Officers should arrange with the police for the safe custody of all ballot boxes and election materials.

"NPP CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR RESPECT OF THE LAW

The Chairman of the New Patriotic Party, Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, has asked Ghana and all institutions involved in the conduct of the 2012 elections as well as the political parties to respect the electoral laws governing this election.

The NPP sympathises with Ghana who have been on their feet, in some instances, for over 11 hours and yet have been disappointed because they could not vote.

The NPP understands that the EC is preparing to continue the process tomorrow and that areas where voting was stopped due to a lack of functional verification machines will vote tomorrow. In such areas, the process, according to the law must be:

1.      COUNT the votes already deposited in the ballot box by biometrically verified voters
2.      RECORD the votes counted
3.      SEAL the ballot box (done by representatives of all parties)

The remaining votes unable to be cast because of verification machine issues will be cast beginning on Saturday morning.  Note that this process of COUNT, RECORD, SEAL only applies to polling stations in which machines failed to function.  In polling places with functioning machines, voting must continue on Friday until all voters who had queued before 5:00 pm have cast their votes.

We further call upon all members of the security services to discharge their duties with integrity, in order to preserve a legal and legitimate election according to the COUNT, RECORD, SEAL process.  If the COUNT, RECORD, SEAL process is not followed, we may seek to annul the results of the votes already cast, and to hold fresh elections.

It is a proud tradition that in every successive Ghanaian election, we strengthen the electoral system and therefore we believe Ghana will bear the inconvenience of continuing to vote tomorrow, rather than open this election to manipulation and in the process destroy the legitimacy we seek as a society.

Ghana is at an important crossroads. NPP urges Ghana to support the EC to deliver a clean, free, fair and legitimate election.

"Statement of the EC on the voting situation at some polling centres:

ADJOURNMENT OF POLL AT POLLING STATIONS WHERE BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION OF VOTERS COULD NOT BE COMPLETED.

The Electoral Commission directs as follows;

(1) At polling stations where the biometric verification of voters could not be completed and as a result some voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,

(2) Where election materials arrived very late that all the voters in the queue could not be processed to vote,polling should continue tomorrow, Saturday 8th December, 2012 to give the opportunity to the affected persons to vote.

Presiding Officers should arrange with the police for the safe custody of all ballot boxes and election materials.
