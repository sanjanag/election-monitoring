"JohnDramaniMahama AND THE NDCâ€™S UNACCEPTABLE SYSTEMATIC RIGGING OF ELECTION 2012
 
The NPP has credible evidence, which undermines the integrity of the electoral process and the results officially released to date in respect of the 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections.  

It is obvious from the preponderance of evidence available to us that at all material times the ruling National Democratic Congress led by President JohnDramaniMahama conspired with certain EC staff in constituencies across the country to falsify the election results and thereby abuse the mandate of the people of Ghana. This situation, if allowed to go unchallenged, would seriously damage the essence of the electoral process and largely democracy in Ghana.

Substantial discrepancies have been discovered from results from collation centres when compared with the official tally figures from the EC. Considering the closeness of the polls this error is very significant and goes to the heart of the credibility of the results. Indeed, we have enough concrete evidence to show that the 2012 presidential election was won by our candidate, NanaAkufo-Addo.

It was this planned, systematic stealing of votes at the collation level that was, thankfully, discovered in time at the Dome Kwabenya constituency, where a substantial amount of 15,000 votes was illegally added to the total vote cast in favour of JohnDramaniMahama of the NDC. Also, in Savelugu constituency, JohnDramaniMahama of the NDC received 21,165 votes according to the EC at the collation centre. However in actual fact, 31,165 votes have been falsely declared for him. Like in all the other instances revealing this pattern of fraud, we have the blue sheets to support this blatant act of rape of the democratic mandate of the people of Ghana. The stealing of votes cast in favour of NanaAkufo-Addo is rife with fraudulent irregularities as reflected in results from Yendi constituency where more than ten thousand votes in that instance have been erased.

Unfortunately, the discovery of some of these criminal acts is done only after the collated results are declared at the constituency. We have noticed a pattern of fraud, where substantial numbers of votes are either added to the NDC candidate or subtracted from the NPP presidential candidate. 

What is especially troubling is that the media have been announcing figures from the constituency collation centres that have obviously been tampered with when compared with figures from the tallying sheets (â€˜blue sheetsâ€™) and this is giving a highly misleading picture to the people of Ghana.  For example, Peace FM and Joy FM have both announced 10,000 more votes for JohnDramaniMahama, the NDC Presidential Candidate, than what was declared for him at the Ledzokuku collation centre, giving him 63,210 (60.53%), instead of 53,210. 

This systematic manipulation of the figures across the country casts serious doubt on the credibility of the results. The manipulation has taken place mainly on the collation sheets. We see the tally figures on the â€˜blue sheetsâ€™ in many constituencies do not match the figures on the collation sheet. 

We demand that the EC conducts an audit of the collated figures as well as the counts from the biometric verification machines before the electoral results are finally released. The biometric machines that were reported to be faulty on the first day of voting in the North, miraculously worked perfectly well the next day without them being replaced or repaired.  
 
The No Verification, No Vote, rule was also blatantly defied in several places, especially in the Upper West, Upper East and Volta Regions. In Bawku Central, Nadowli, and Salaga South, for example, high voter turnouts were registered in areas where voting occurred without the use of the verification machine. In North Tongu, for example where there was no verification, the effect of non-verification obvious. JohnDramaniMahama supposedly got 34,162 in North Tongu without verification. This happened with the direct collusion of polling station officers and upwards, after the President personally called for a violation of this rule.

The size of this manipulation has influenced the final outcome. Also consistent with this systematic manipulation is the fact that the total votes cast at the presidential level are far higher than the votes cast for parliamentary candidates and most of the time we have seen this happening, are the very places where we see the collation figures manipulated.

We call upon our party members and the general public to ignore the tainted provisional results announced through the mass media. Indeed, already the election has been called for the NDC candidate by one major media house, Multi Media.  But, there again discrepancies have been detected. For example, for Berekum West, Joy FM gave the NDC presidential candidate 7,750 and the NPP presidential candidate, 10,189. But, the ECâ€™s own results on its website, state 9,091 for the NDC and 6,236 for the NPP. Also in Akwatia, Joy gives the NDC candidate 19,118 and the NPP candidate 20,678. The EC, on the other hand, gives the NDC candidate 18,963 and the NPP candidate 20,506 votes. So, we call on the people of Ghana to remain calm and wait for a proper audit of the results before declaration.

The connivance of EC staff in this electoral fraud is most worrying. For example, in the Yapei/Kusawgu constituency, the presiding officer at the Kakalito polling station recorded zero (0) for our presidential candidate. However upon a recount of the ballots, our candidate got forty-nine (49) votes. 
 
Our Presidential Candidate, NanaAkufo-Addo earlier on raised these serious concerns about the reliability of the election results with the ECOWAS observer mission headed by Gen Obasanjo when they paid a visit to him this morning. 

We respectfully demand the EC not to release any official result until these extremely serious concerns are investigated thoroughly and its findings pronounced.  We also call for an immediate meeting with Chairman of the Electoral Commission. These results cannot be forced down on the people of Ghana as same will be subversive of their constitutional right to determine who leads them.",Nana Akufo Addo Facebook,12/9/2012 15:35,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,,,,,,

"Why the Best Candidate Did Not Win - By Kofi Thompson, an independent blogger:

When a friend in the U.S.A. asked me who I thought would win the presidential election in Ghana, for an answer, I told him who I knew would definitely not win that election - by recounting to him what a brilliant young female student told me, when I asked a group of university students the same question.

In the view of that brilliant female student, nothing would change in Ghana, regardless of which candidate of the two major political parties that have governed the nation since the 1992 constitution was promulgated - the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party - won the presidential election, because both simply lacked the political will to fight high-level corruption: which she regarded as the biggest nation-building challenge facing Ghana.

The tragedy for Ghana, she said, was that the person who had shown, by deed, not words - by making public the results of the medical examination he underwent to show he was medically fit for the ardours task of leading Ghana; releasing his filed tax returns and declaring his assets openly to the media; as well as showing the amount spent on campaigning by the party he founded, and the sources of its funding to show he was transparent about financial matters he was associated with - would not win the presidential election.

She ended by saying she was certain that Ghana (a nation full of ""My-party-my-tribe-right-or-wrong"" myrmidon-types) would miss the opportunity to elect the candidate who had shown the discerning that he was the most suitable politician to lead the Ghana of today, for a number of reasons - all of them negative.

To begin with, it was her opinion that Dr. Paa Kwesi Nduom of the Progressive Peoples Party would not win the presidential election, because: ""Behind the facade of modernity, in terms of the psychology of a majority of the populace, in a sense, Ghana is a nation in which superstition is rife and deeply woven into the fabric of society. That is one of the reasons why the political party most favoured by sundry crooks-in-dog-collars - who speak in 'tongues' and exert a malevolent influence over the minds of the millions who flock to their churches regularly to seek 'prophetic anointing' and 'protection from spiritual enemies' - can garner a substantial number of votes in elections. And, lastly, tribal bigotry is written into the DNA of some of the most prominent and influential of today's descendants of the pre-colonial traditional ruling elites - who, even though it is a democracy, still seek to dominate the Republic of Ghana through the back-door by proxy - and those ordinary Ghana who hold fealty to them, often demonstrate their allegiance by voting for the political parties such tribal-supremacist traditionalists support."" And well said, say I.

How insightful that young Ghanaian was. Alas, indeed as it turned out, most voters did not vote for the candidate who by voluntarily undergoing a medical examination and making public the results, as well as releasing his filed tax returns from the 1980's to date; and publicly declaring his assets to the media, and topped all that by revealing the total amount spent by the party he founded and the sources of its funding, showed Ghana (including a doubting-Thomas like me who has often criticised him in the past for attempting a reverse-takeover of the party founded by the great Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the Convention Peoples Party - and advised he leave Nkrumah's party to set up one of his own, in which he could call the shots), that in good governance terms, he was the best amongst this year's crop of presidential candidates - and could offer the kind of sorely-needed world-class leadership (underpinned by an ethical ethos), which the people of Ghana and their peaceful and democratic nation require to prosper.

Sadly, dear reader, as it turns out that young female university student was right in asserting that the candidate who proved he was best suited to lead Ghana, would not win the presidential election - and that Mother Ghana will be the worst for it. Pity.
